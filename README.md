# Tools
Literally just a bunch of tools I use for various things. I'm not going to go into detail about each one, but heres a general idea of the structure of this repository:

- `/` - Well its the root directory, what do you expect? It just contains this README and some tools
- `/scripts` - Normally bash scripts but could be anything really
- `/scripts/commands` - Commands that will be compiled into a binary and put in `/bin`
